## Versioning Guidelines

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):
- **Major** (X): Significant changes, likely with breaking compatibility.
- **Minor** (Y): New features that are backward-compatible.

- **[2.0.1]** for a minor fix that doesnâ€™t break existing functionality.

## Best Practices

1. **One Entry per Change**: Each update, bug fix, or new feature should have its own entry.
2. **Be Concise**: Keep descriptions brief and informative.
3. **Link Issues or MRs**: Where possible, reference related issues or merge requests for easy tracking.
4. **Date Each Release**: Add the release date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format for each version.
5. **Organize Unreleased Changes**: Document ongoing changes under the `[Unreleased]` section, which can be merged into the next release version.
