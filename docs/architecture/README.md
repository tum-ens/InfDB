# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the system architecture of the InfDB project.

- **Component Diagrams**: Visual representations of system components and their relationships
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Illustrations of how data moves through the system
- **Database Schema**: Documentation of the database structure and relationships
- **API Architecture**: Description of the API design and endpoints
- **Integration Points**: Documentation of how the system integrates with external services

## Key Files

- [index.md](index.rst): Main architecture documentation entry point
- Database schema diagrams
- Component interaction diagrams
