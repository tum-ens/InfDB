Welcome to InfDB Documentation
==============================

**InfDB (Infrastructure Database)** is designed to create comprehensive digital twins of energy infrastructure systems, enabling advanced modeling, analysis, and planning of energy networks. This database system integrates geospatial data with time-series information to provide a complete representation of energy systems.

What is InfDB For?
------------------

InfDB serves as a foundation for:

- **Energy System Modeling**: Create detailed digital representations of electrical grids, heating networks, and gas infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure Planning**: Support decision-making for future energy infrastructure development and optimization.
- **Scenario Analysis**: Model and compare different energy system configurations and their impacts.
- **Time-Series Integration**: Combine static infrastructure data with dynamic measurements like weather conditions and energy consumption.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Analyze spatial relationships between energy infrastructure components and their environment.
