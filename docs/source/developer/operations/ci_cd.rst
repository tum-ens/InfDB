CI/CD Guide for GitLab
=======================

This document serves as a guide to the stages and jobs defined in the ``.gitlab-ci.yml`` file for Python projects. It also provides best practices for each stage to help you set up a robust, maintainable CI/CD pipeline.

Overview of CI/CD Stages
------------------------

A typical CI/CD pipeline for Python projects may include the following stages:

1. Install – Prepares the environment by installing dependencies.
2. Lint – Checks code style and quality.
3. Test – Runs automated tests to verify functionality.
4. Build – (Optional) Packages the code into a deployable artifact.
5. Code Quality and Security Scanning – (Optional) Scans for vulnerabilities and potential issues.
6. Staging/Pre-Deployment Testing – (Optional) Tests in an environment similar to production.
7. Deployment – (Optional) Deploys the code to production.
8. Notification and Reporting – Sends updates on build status and results.

Not all stages are necessary for every project. Choose the stages based on the project's complexity, team size, and requirements.

Detailed Stages and Best Practices
----------------------------------

Install
^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Sets up the environment by installing dependencies.

**Why Important**: Ensures that the project can build and run successfully.

**Typical Jobs**:

- Installing project dependencies using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
- Setting up virtual environments and caching for faster builds

**Best Practices**:

- Use a base image with the necessary tools and dependencies.
- Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent builds.
- Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   install_dependencies:
     stage: install
     image: python:3.12
     script:
       - python -m venv venv
       - source venv/bin/activate
       - pip install -r requirements.txt
     cache:
       paths:
         - .cache/pip
     artifacts:
       paths:
         - venv

Linting/Static Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Checks code quality and adherence to style guidelines.

**Why Important**: Helps catch errors early, enforces code consistency, and maintains readability.

**Typical Tools**:

- ``flake8`` for code quality and PEP 8 compliance
- ``black --check`` for formatting
- ``mypy`` for static type checking

**Best Practices**:

- Run linters on every commit to catch issues early.
- Configure linters to match the project style.
- Use pre-commit hooks to enforce linting before committing code.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   lint:
     stage: lint
     image: python:3.12
     script:
       - source venv/bin/activate
       - flake8 path/to/your/code
       - black --check path/to/your/code
       - mypy path/to/your/code

Testing (Unit, Integration, End-to-End)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Runs automated tests to verify that the code behaves as expected.

**Why Important**: Ensures reliability and catches bugs before production.

**Typical Tools**:

- ``pytest`` for unit and integration tests
- ``selenium`` for end-to-end tests

**Best Practices**:

- Use ``pytest`` with options for test reports and code coverage.
- Run tests across Python versions using GitLab’s ``matrix`` feature.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   test:
     stage: test
     image: python:$PYTHON_VERSION
     variables:
       PYTHON_VERSION: $PYTHON_VERSIONS
     parallel:
       matrix:
         - PYTHON_VERSION: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
     script:
       - python -m venv venv
       - source venv/bin/activate
       - pip install -r requirements.txt
       - pytest tests/ --junitxml=junit/test-report.xml --cov=path/to/your/code
     artifacts:
       reports:
         junit: junit/test-report.xml
         coverage_report:
           coverage_format: cobertura
           path: coverage.xml

Build (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Packages the code into a deployable artifact.

**Why Important**: Makes deployments consistent and reproducible.

**Typical Tools**:

- ``docker build`` for containers
- ``setuptools`` for packages
- ``poetry`` for dependency management

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   build:
     stage: build
     image: python:3.12
     script:
       - echo "Building project artifacts..."
       # Add build commands here

Code Quality and Security Scanning (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Scans for vulnerabilities and potential issues.

**Why Important**: Improves security and maintainability.

**Typical Tools**:

- ``bandit`` for security scanning
- ``safety`` for dependency checks
- ``pylint`` for code quality
- ``sonarqube`` for full code analysis

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   code_quality:
     stage: code_quality
     image: python:3.12
     script:
       - bandit -r path/to/your/code
       - safety check
       - pylint path/to/your/code

Staging/Pre-Deployment Testing (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Tests the app in a staging environment similar to production.

**Why Important**: Catches production-like issues early.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   staging_deployment:
     stage: staging
     script:
       - echo "Deploying to staging environment..."
       # Add staging deployment commands

Deployment (Production/Release) (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Deploys the application to users or production systems.

**Why Important**: Releases updates in a controlled and reliable manner.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   deploy:
     stage: deploy
     image: alpine:latest
     script:
       - echo "Deploying application..."
       # Add deployment commands here
     only:
       - main

Notification and Reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Purpose**: Sends updates on pipeline status.

**Why Important**: Keeps the team informed and accountable.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: yaml

   notify:
     stage: notify
     script:
       - echo "Sending notification..."
       # Add Slack or email notification commands

CI/CD Pipeline Best Practices
-----------------------------

1. **Use Version Pinning**: Pin dependencies in ``requirements.txt``.
2. **Fail Fast**: Run install/lint early to fail quickly on issues.
3. **Leverage Caching**: Cache dependencies and build artifacts.
4. **Parallelize Tests**: Use GitLab matrix jobs to reduce test time.
5. **Store Artifacts**: Save reports and logs for debugging and auditing.
