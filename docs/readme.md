# Project Documentation

This project uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) for documentation, which is built and published automatically on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

To build the documentation locally:

1. Navigate to the `docs` folder:

    ```bash
    cd docs
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Building Locally

To build the HTML version of the documentation manually:

```bash
make html
```

## To automatically rebuild and serve the documentation with live reloading (suggested to use)
Assuming that you are already in /docs directory:

```bash
sphinx-autobuild source/ source/_build/html --port 9000
```

This will start a local server at http://localhost:9000. I do not suggest 8000 since it is a common port for many services.

## üìñ Documentation Standards

When contributing to the documentation:

1. Use **Markdown** for all internal documentation files, **except** where specific formats like reStructuredText (`.rst`) are required (e.g., in the `source/` folder for Read the Docs).
2. Always include a **clear title and description** at the top of each document.
3. Use **relative links** when referencing other files.
4. Place images in the `img/` directory and reference them using relative paths.
5. Keep documentation in sync with code and implementation changes.
6. Follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) for writing standards.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

A quick overview of the documentation directory structure:

- `docs/` ‚Äì Root directory for all documentation-related files.
- `docs/css/` ‚Äì Contains custom CSS files for theming the generated HTML.
- `docs/img/` ‚Äì Holds images used throughout the documentation.

  - `api/` ‚Äì Development guide for the API structure.
  - `architecture/` ‚Äì System-level architecture and design docs.
  - `ci_cd/`, `repository/`, `services/`, `workflow/`, etc. ‚Äì Internal guides and module-specific details.
- `docs/source/user/` ‚Äì User-facing documentation (API usage, architecture explanation, service access).
