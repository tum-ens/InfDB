# API Error Handling and Development Best Practices

This guide outlines how InfDB handles errors and outlines conventions to ensure a reliable, performant, and secure API experience.

It also highlights expectations for new contributorsâ€”such as writing robust endpoints, following consistent design patterns, and preparing for production-scale deployment.


## Purpose

The FastAPI-based backend of InfDB serves as a bridge between complex geospatial and temporal databases. Given the nature of user-facing APIs, **clear error reporting**, **input validation**, and **consistency** are essential.

This document explains:

- How errors are handled and communicated
- What practices are expected when writing new endpoints
- Where the API needs improvement (e.g., auth, rate limits)
- How developers can contribute code that is scalable, secure, and testable


## Error Handling Strategy

InfDB uses standard **HTTP status codes** to report the outcome of each API request:

| Code | Meaning                         | Typical Use                                      |
|------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 200  | OK                               | Successful request                               |
| 201  | Created                          | New resource created                             |
| 400  | Bad Request                      | Client-side input issue                          |
| 404  | Not Found                        | Resource doesn't exist                           |
| 422  | Unprocessable Entity             | Validation errors from FastAPI/Pydantic          |
| 500  | Internal Server Error            | Unexpected server-side failures                  |

Errors should be informative and never leak internal details (e.g., stack traces, SQL errors).

## Custom Exceptions

You can also create **reusable custom exceptions** for complex validation tasks. This allows you to wrap business logic in a consistent and clean interface, while attaching meaningful error messages and optional metadata.

``` python
class YourCustomException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message, details=None):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.details = details
```

**Usage in endpoints:**

``` python
@router.get("/{item_id}")
async def get_item(item_id: int):
    item = service.get_item(item_id)
    if not item:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Item not found")
    return item
```

## Planned Improvements

### Authentication (Not Yet Implemented)

Although InfDB is currently in development, we plan to support:

- **API keys** for basic client identification  
- **OAuth2 with scopes** for permission-based access  
- **Dependency injection** via FastAPI's built-in security mechanisms  

These features will ensure that critical endpoints (such as data uploads or simulation triggers) are **protected from anonymous or unauthorized access**.


### Rate Limiting (Planned)

To safeguard server performance and prevent abuse:

- **Rate limiting** will be implemented via FastAPI middleware or an external reverse proxy like **Traefik** or **NGINX**
- Limits may be applied per:
  - IP address
  - API key
  - Route or endpoint group

 Best Practices

### Performance

-   Use `async` endpoints
-   Index frequently queried columns
-   Paginate long result sets
-   Consider in-memory or Redis caching

### Documentation

-   Use descriptive function names and docstrings
-   Add examples in OpenAPI where possible
-   Keep `/docs` and `/redoc` clean and consistent

### Testing

-   Use FastAPI `TestClient`
-   Mock DB or services for isolation
-   Test edge cases and invalid inputs

### Security

-   Validate all inputs
-   Use ORM or parameterized queries
-   Avoid exposing internal details in errors
-   Enforce role-based or token-based access as needed
