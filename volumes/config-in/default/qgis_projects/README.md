*NOTE*: This folder is only useful for QGS Projects which should be processed by the "split categorized layers" function, see [https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator#split-categorized-layers](https://github.com/qwc-services/qwc-config-generator#split-categorized-layers). 
For other cases, you'll want to store your projects in `volumes/qgs-resources` directory (for themes for which you provide an explicit configuration in `tenantConfig.json`) or in the `volumes/qgs-resources/scan` folder (for themes with autogenerated configuration).
